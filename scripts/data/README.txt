This distribution contains data analyzed by the sv-callers workflow (v1.1.0).
It includes sequence files in FASTA, ENCODE regions in BED, detected structural
variants (SVs) in VCF, workflow config files and Jupyter Notebook with R code
that compares the SV call sets and generates figures (Venn & UpSet diagrams).
Large BAMs including index files were excluded due to max. upload file size,
however, these files are freely available from the NCBI FTP server and the ENA
database (see README files).
